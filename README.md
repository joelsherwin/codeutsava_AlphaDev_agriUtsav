Like online shopping, now the farmers will be able to order farming related items(tools,equipments, raw materials etc) while sitting at their homes and get their orders delivered directly to their home and without having to pay any extra charges for this.
 NACOF, the world's largest fertilizer co-operative, announced today that it will start the service to reach the farmhouse. NACOF will deliver its product to farmers through its digital platform Indian Co-operative Digital Platform (ICDP). Through this service, NACOF will provide farmers with water-soluble fertilizers, agro-chemicals, bio-fertilizers, seeds, protecting plants, and other agricultural based products. These products will be available in packing up to five kilograms and will be delivered to the farmers without any additional value.
Sales of conventional fertilizers like Urea, DAP, NPK etc. will not be online.
